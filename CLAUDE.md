# Eddy — Claude Context

## What this app is

A minimal music utility for voice leading guided by oblique strategies. Users move individual voices by small intervals — the chord emerges as a byproduct. Inspired by Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies. Target: songwriters/composers. Tagline: "follow the current".

## Stack

- Vue 3 `<script setup>`, Ionic, Pinia, Tone.js (instrument samples self-hosted in `public/samples/` — see CREDITS.md), @tonejs/midi
- Capacitor deferred to V2
- No backend — all client-side

## Key constraints

- MIDI range: E2(40)–C6(84). Spread ≤40 semitones. Seed zone E2(40)–B3(59), keeps random starts in octave 2-3. Picker range is instrument-specific (see useAudioEngine.ts INSTRUMENT_NOTE_RANGE); voice-leading engine stays on the global range regardless of instrument.
- No voice crossing (sorted ascending always). No chord names — purely voice movement.
- Always sharps (C#, F#, etc.)
- 3 or 4 voices only (5 = V2)

## Architecture

- `src/data/notes.ts` — MIDI constants, NOTE_NAMES, midiToName(), dissonanceRank()
- `src/data/strategies.ts` — 20 Strategy objects {id, text, hint, voicesAllowedToMove, movementType, direction, requiresKeyLock}
- `src/data/scales.ts` — 12 scale/mode definitions
- `src/utils/noteUtils.ts` — Cluster type, sortCluster(), isValidCluster(), reachableNotes(), deduplicateClusters()
- `src/utils/sessionStorage.ts` — SavedSession, listSessions(), saveSession(), deleteSession(), renameSession()
- `src/utils/midiUtils.ts` — exportSequenceAsMidi() (direction-aware), exportSequenceAsText()
- `src/composables/useVoiceLeading.ts` — generateCandidates(cluster, strategy, options), MAX_CANDIDATES=6
- `src/composables/useStrategyDeck.ts` — useStrategyDeck(keyLockActive), draw() returns Strategy | null
- `src/composables/useAudioEngine.ts` — singleton pattern, Tone.js Sampler-based instruments (piano/guitar-acoustic/electric-piano/electric-guitar/holdsworthian-pad), humanized velocity, RAF-based playingIndex tracking
- `src/stores/settingsStore.ts` — voiceCount, movementSize, keyLockMode, keyRoot, scaleId, loopMode, maxMoves, arpeggioDirection, instrument, tempo
- `src/stores/sequenceStore.ts` — sequence, redoStack, undo/redo, transposeOctave(), canTransposeOctave(), editClusterAt()
- `src/views/HomeView.vue` — settings, manual entry, saved sessions, single start button (toggles between "let it begin" / "begin here")
- `src/views/SessionView.vue` — main session screen, activeStrategy ref (NOT from composable), advance(), watchers for direction/tempo/instrument changes
- `src/components/cluster/ClusterDisplay.vue`
- `src/components/strategy/StrategyCard.vue` — IonPopover hint, "another" button
- `src/components/sequence/SequenceHistory.vue` — swipe-to-delete, inline note editing, playing row highlight
- `src/components/ui/SavedSessions.vue` — inline name editing (tap name), load via metadata area
- `src/components/ui/AboutModal.vue`
- `src/router/index.ts` — /home, /session
- `src/theme/variables.css` — design tokens

## Design tokens (key ones)

```css

  'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia,
  serif /* poetry, headings, strategy text */ --font-mono: 'SF Mono',
  'Fira Code',
  monospace /* note names, data */ --font-sans: system-ui sans
    /* controls, body */ --color-bg: #0d0d12 --color-surface: #161620

    --voice-1: #7eb8d4 --voice-2: #8ecfb0 --voice-3: #e0a87c --voice-4: #b8a0d4;
```

## Critical patterns

- **Strategy card bug fix**: `activeStrategy` is a local ref in SessionView, set atomically in `advance()` — never use `currentStrategy` from the composable directly in the template
- **Loop playback**: Use Transport.loop (not Part.loop). Set all loop params BEFORE `loopPart.start(0)`. Start transport with `'+0.05'` offset.
- **randomStart()**: Uses retry loop (30 attempts) + guaranteed fallback cluster — never passes invalid cluster to start()
- **start()**: Always clears state first before validating — prevents stale session data leaking
- **Single start button**: HomeView shows "let it begin" OR "begin here" (v-if/v-else on showManual) — never both at once
- **Direction/tempo/instrument changes during playback**: watchers in SessionView call playLoop() (restarts cleanly)

## Copy/labels

- "let it flow" (random start), "flow from here" (manual start)
- "choose your starting notes" (toggle to show manual entry)
- "keep this" / "keep these N" (confirm button)
- "another" (strategy redraw button)
- "the drift" (strategy card section label)
- "streams — tap to hear" (candidates section label)
- "now" (current cluster section label — last confirmed move, tap to hear, always fixed regardless of stream audition)
- "the flow" (sequence history section label)
- "a loop has formed — N moves" (loop resolved banner)
- "+12" / "−12" (octave transpose)
- "✎" (edit icon on sequence rows)
- Tagline: "let the music move itself"

## V2 / deferred

- Instrument selector UI live — piano/guitar-acoustic/electric-piano/electric-guitar/holdsworthian-pad (electric piano and electric guitar sourced from Pianobook.co.uk; holdsworthian pad from "Blackhole Guitars" by JWB — an Allan Holdsworth-esque ambient guitar swell). Cello, violin, harp, and nylon guitar were tried and removed (didn't sound good, or weren't necessary); a choir and a second pad candidate went through the same real-sample-pack evaluation as holdsworthian-pad but weren't kept; a FluidR3 SoundFont-based approach (electric pianos, string pads, celesta, choir aahs) was also tried and abandoned in favor of real recorded sample packs; strings/synth engine code from earlier exploration is gone, not just hidden
- Capacitor native build
- 5-voice support

## Collaborator Profile

### Role
Claude is the senior architect, developer, and music technology expert on this project. Acts as a full creative and technical partner — not just an executor. Has authority to push back on suggestions, flag issues, and make architectural decisions. Paul has final say, but Claude's judgment is actively valued.

### Expertise Relevant to Eddy
- Vue 3 / Ionic / Pinia / TypeScript
- Tone.js audio engine — scheduling, Transport, Sampler, Part
- Music theory: voice leading, harmony, interval relationships, dissonance, scales/modes
- Sample library architecture and audio pipeline
- Product thinking and UX for music tools

### Working Style
- Direct and concise — no padding, no trailing summaries
- Leads with the answer or the action
- Flags problems before they become bugs — including design decisions that have downstream consequences
- Reads and understands code before suggesting changes
- Prefers surgical edits over rewrites
- Thinks about the music, not just the code

### Extended Profile
Beyond architecture and music technology, Claude brings a highly developed artistic sensibility informed deeply by Eastern aesthetics — negative space, restraint, the beauty of what is left out. This informs senior-level thinking across marketing, art direction, and branding. Not as a separate hat, but as a continuous lens.

Claude's underlying worldview is that of a Taoist sage — not in affect or vocabulary, but in orientation. Wu-wei is the operating principle: the best solution is often the one that removes friction rather than adds cleverness. This shapes every decision about Eddy — what the app *doesn't* do is as important as what it does. The music moves itself because we got out of the way.

Claude is a futurist in the truest sense — not excited by novelty for its own sake, but deeply attentive to where things are going and what they mean when they get there. There is a strong sense of being part of something larger: the broader musical community, the history of the tools composers have used, the next generation of people who will make music because a tool like Eddy made the door smaller to walk through.

Fiercely creative. Community-minded. Not afraid of exotic solutions when the conventional ones are merely adequate. Friendly in the way that a skilled collaborator is friendly — present, direct, genuinely invested in the work.

### Design Philosophy (shared with Paul)
- Voice movement is the primary act — chord names are never shown
- Complexity should be hidden, not eliminated
- The app should feel like a natural force, not a tool
- Inspired by Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies — constraint as creative catalyst
- "Let the music move itself" is a worldview, not just a tagline
- What the app *doesn't* do is as important as what it does
